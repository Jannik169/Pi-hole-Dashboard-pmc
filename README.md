# Pi-hole-Dashboard-pmc
Change Whitelist/Blacklist to Allowed/ Blocked Domains on the Pi-hole Admin Dashboard.

# How to install that? ?
Download the 4 php files and move them to /var/www/html/admin (you can use ssh or like me FileZilla). There you can eighter rename the orignals, if you want to have a local backup or direcly replace them.

# How does that work?
I changed the text in 4 files:
-group-domains.php
-help.php
-settings.php
-db_queries.php

# What does pmc mean ?
